## Dependencies

Maven - install this first, the command line tool

## To Run

```bash
cd gridworld
make
make small # this will run small grid world
make large # this will run large grid world
```

You should be able to open the project up in IntelliJ. I've been running it from there,
but you'll likely still need maven.


Since I'm writing this very last-second, I will not be able to offer any support by the deadline of the project. Sorry! Good luck though!
